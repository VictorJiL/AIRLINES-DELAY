-OBJECTIVE

This Project is for the learning track of #NG30daysoflearning, Airline Delay Storytelling.The dataset contain 539383 IDS having the number for flights from different Airports. The purpose of the Project is  to find Factors that Influenced the delayed Flights and give an insightful story that will aid Better future flight experience. 


DATA SOURCING

-Microsoft Excel was used to separate the Relevant datas needed into different Single Tables Included in the Dataset for easy Identification and the redundant datas were removed. 

-Microsoft Power BI Desktop was used to create the Dashboard and the Content Analysis


FINDINGS 

CONTENT ANALYSIS

DASHBOARD

I was able to ascertain the Total Airlines for the Time period, Total Number of Days, Total Number of Delayed Flights and Not Delayed Flights. The WN AIRLINE HAS HIGHEST NUMBER OF DELAYED FLIGHTS While HA AIRLINE HAS THE LOWEST NUMBER OF DELAYED FLIGHTS.  

The DL AIRLINE HAS THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF NOT DELAYED FLIGHT While F9 AIRLINE HAS THE LOWEST NUMBER OF NOT DELAYED FLIGHTS

RECOMMENDATION

In order to have a better flight experience i recommend Flight Travels through MQ AIRLINE, US AIRLINE, UA AIRLINE because they have higher Rates based on NOT DELAYED FLIGHTS even though they are still present on DELAYED FLIGHTS DATA but they are part of Airlines with lower rates of delayed flights.
